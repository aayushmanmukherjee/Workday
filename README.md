# **Workday**
Workday is a day-to-day task management app implementing Eisenhower Matrix system.

Each day's tasks are divided into four groups:
- **Must do** - Urgent and important things that must get done on that day.
- **Schedule for the day** - Important but not urgent tasks you want to make time for the day.
- **Ask for help** - Small tasks you can ask someone else to handle.
- **Can be postponed** - Distractions and low-value tasks you can skip for the day or push to another day.
